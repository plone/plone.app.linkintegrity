Changelog
=========

1.5.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Dexterity: use zope.lifecycleevent instead of zope.app.container
  interfaces for Plone 4.3 support.
  [jone]

- Avoid a bug during link integrity check when a source or target of the
  reference has been already removed during the deletion process.
  This can happen during large delete processes.
  [thomasdesvenain]
- Monkey patch the Zope HTTPResponse status_code to include a mapping for 
  linkintegritynotificationexception, to return a 200 code. 
  [thepjot]

1.5.0 (2013-01-17)
------------------
- Fix a remove confirmation view bug. 
  Displays the portal type title rather than the portal type name.
  This change also broke some tests that were checking for the name 
  rather than the title, but I just fixed those.
  [jianaijun]

- Added support for Dexterity content types.  Link integrity
  support for Dexterity requires the plone.app.referenceablebehavior
  behavior to be enabled so that the Dexterity item can be used
  with Archetypes references.

  [davisagli]

- Stabilize the sort order of breach sources returned for the
  confirmation view.
  [davisagli]

  [malthe]

  these ourselves instead of relying on a view or script (which doesn't work).
  This fixes linkintegrity for sites with link-by-uid turned on.
