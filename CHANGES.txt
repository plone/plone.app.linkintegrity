Changelog
=========

1.4.5 - 2012-02-24
------------------

- Fix an error in handling absolute links to objects within the portal,

  [davisagli]

- Stabilize the sort order of breach sources returned for the
  confirmation view.
  [davisagli]

- Use the `get` method to retrieve the field value if the instance
  does not provide an accessor method. This is the case for instance
  for fields which have been added via schema extension.

- Support resolveuid/UID references explicitely, by parsing and resolving
  these ourselves instead of relying on a view or script (which doesn't work).
  This fixes linkintegrity for sites with link-by-uid turned on.
