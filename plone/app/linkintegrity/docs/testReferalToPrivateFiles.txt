This tests the behaviour of the link integrity code when a to be deleted
item is referred to by some page the current user has no permission to view.
In this case the privacy of the linking user should be protected, so neither
the name or url of the linking page should be shown.  First we need to create
the link in question and set up the permissions accordingly:

  >>> doc = portal.doc1
  >>> img = portal.image1
  >>> self.setRoles(('Manager',))
  >>> self.setText(doc, img.tag())
  >>> self.setRoles(('Member',))
  >>> portal.manage_permission('List folder contents', roles=('Member',))
  >>> portal.manage_permission('Delete objects', roles=('Member',))
  >>> doc.manage_permission('View', roles=('Manager',), acquire=0)
  >>> doc.manage_permission('Access contents information', roles=('Manager',), acquire=0)
  >>> checkPermission = portal.portal_membership.checkPermission
  >>> self.failIf(checkPermission('View', doc))
  >>> self.failIf(checkPermission('Access contents information', doc))
  >>> self.failUnless(checkPermission('View', img))
  >>> self.failUnless(checkPermission('Access contents information', img))

Next we use a browser to try to delete the image used in the document.  Before
we can do this we need to prevent the test framework from choking on the
exception we intentionally throw again (see
docs/testRemovalTriggersConfirmation.txt for more info):

  >>> self.setStatusCode('LinkIntegrityNotificationException', 200)

Now we can go ahead and try to delete the image and thereby check if we're
told we cannot access the document referencing our image:

  >>> browser = self.getBrowser(loggedIn=True)
  >>> browser.open('http://nohost/plone/folder_contents')
  >>> browser.getControl('Test Image 1').selected = True
  >>> browser.getControl('Delete').click()
  >>> browser.contents
  '...<form ... action="http://nohost/plone/removeConfirmationAction">...
   ...<a href="http://nohost/plone/image1"...Test Image 1...
   ...This...Image...is referenced by the following items:...
   ...<ul>...The item is not accessible...</ul>...
   ...Would you like to delete it anyway?...'
